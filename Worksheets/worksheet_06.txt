     For each of the first two questions, write out your best guess as to what the
     code will print. Clearly label this as your guess. Then run the code and look at
     the output. Write if your guess was correct. If it was not, briefly describe what
     was different and why.

     Predicting what the code will do is important in writing programs, and
     figuring out why programs don't run the way expected.
     
  1. What does this program print out?
     (Remember: TWO answers. Your guess and the actual result. Label both.)
     
     x = 0
     while x < 10:
         print(x)
         x = x + 2
     Guess: Prints out 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 on seperate lines.
     Answer: Prints out 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 on seperate lines.
  2. What does this program print out?
     
     x = 1
     while x < 64:
         print(x)
         x = x * 2
     Guess: Prints out 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 on seperate lines.
     Answer: Prints out 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 on seperate lines.
  3. Why is the and x >= 0 not needed?
     
     x = 0
     while x < 10 and x >= 0:
         print(x)
         x = x + 2
     It does not need to be checked because x is set to start at 0, and there is no chance of it ever going down in value.
  4. What does this program print out? (0 pts) Explain. (1 pt)
     
     x = 5
     while x >= 0:
         print(x)
         if x == "1":
             print("Blast off!")
         x = x - 1
     This program prints out 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 on seperate lines. This prints only that out because an integer can never equal a string, because the programmer put quotations around 1, it will never be equal to that and will then never print out "Blast off!".
  5. Fix the following code so it doesn't repeat forever, and keeps asking
     the user until he or she enters a number greater than zero: (2 pts)
     
     x = float(input("Enter a number greater than zero: "))

     while x <= 0:
         print("Too small. Enter a number greater than zero: ")
     
  6. Fix the following code:
     
     x = 10

     while x < 0:
         print(x)
         x - 1

     print("Blast-off")
     
  7. What is wrong with this code? It runs but it has unnecessary code.
     Find all the unneeded code. Also, answer why it is not needed. (1 pt)
     
     i = 0
     for i in range(10):
         print(i)
         i += 1
     
  8. Explain why the values printed for x are so different. (2 pts)
     
     # Sample 1
     x = 0
     for i in range(10):
         x += 1
     for j in range(10):
         x += 1
     print(x)

     # Sample 2
     x = 0
     for i in range(10):
         x += 1
         for j in range(10):
             x += 1
     print(x)
